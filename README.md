# üé¨ Movie Review Classifier
This is a movie review sentiment classifier built using both machine learning and deep learning techniques. It combines a fast Naive Bayes model with a context-aware BiLSTM to provide reliable classification. The tool runs locally and includes a simple, interactive web interface for input and results.

## ‚ö° Features
- Utilizes the IMDB movie review dataset with predefined train/test splits  
- Text preprocessing includes lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, tokenization, and lemmatization  
- Implements stratified 5-fold cross-validation for reliable model evaluation  
- Two sentiment classifiers:  
  - Naive Bayes ‚Äì a lightweight, classical machine learning baseline  
  - BiLSTM ‚Äì a custom-trained deep learning model with contextual understanding  
- BiLSTM achieves ~85.8% accuracy on the test set  
- Naive Bayes reaches ~82.3% accuracy  
- GPU support enabled for BiLSTM via PyTorch CUDA  
- Multithreading for faster data loading and preprocessing  
- Interactive web interface to input reviews and view results  
- Option to choose between models at runtime  
- Frontend built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript  
- Flask-based backend API  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- Text Processing: NLTK
- Model Training: Scikit-Learn + PyTorch
- Visualization: matplotlib
- Frontend: HTML + Tailwind CSS + JavaScript
- Backend: Python + Flask
